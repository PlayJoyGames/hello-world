Hello Earth,

Don't panic! Just make sure you know where your towel is.

42 is the answer:

M  +  A  +  T  +  H

13 +  1  +  20 +  8



It takes 42 minutes to fly through earth from one side to the other.

"A scenario often presented to introductory physics classes is that of a "gravity tunnel" — a tube drilled from one side of the Earth to the other through the planet's center. The answer taught for nearly a half-century for how long a fall through such a hole would take was about 42 minutes and 12 seconds.

The solution to this problem depends on the strength of Earth's gravitational pull, which in turn is based on its mass. As one falls through the planet, there is less mass beneath whoever is making the descent over time, so the force of the gravity experienced would lessen as one approached Earth's center."

It takes about 42 seconds to wash your hands correctly.

"In a study published in the journal of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10267985&fileId=S0899823X16000519 ), scientists in Scotland found that an alternative technique, recommended by the World Health Organization, was significantly more effective in reducing the median bacteria count on participants’ hands.

It was also more time-consuming. The C.D.C. method takes 35 seconds on average to complete; the alternative, 42.5 seconds."
